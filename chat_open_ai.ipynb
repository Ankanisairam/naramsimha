In hospitals, pathogens\\npresent in waste remain in the air in the form of spores. This can result in hospital acquired\\ninfections and is an occupational health hazard. In congested areas, slums and rural areas\\nburning of firewood and biomass results in lot of smoke. Children and ladies exposed to\\nsmoke may suffer from acute respiratory problems which include running nose, cough,\\nsore throat, lung infection, asthama, difficulty in breathing, noisy respiration and wheezing.\\n(ii) Prevention and control of indoor air pollution\\nUse of wood and dung cakes should be replaced by cleaner fuels such as biogas, kerosene\\nor electricity . But supply of electricity is limited. Similarly kerosene is also limited. Improved\\nstoves for looking like smokeless chullahs have high thermal efficiency and reduced emission\\nof pollutants including smoke. The house designs should incorporate a well ventilated\\nkitchen. Use of biogas and CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) need to be encouraged.\\nThose species of trees such as baval ( Acacia nilotica ) which are least smoky should be\\nplanted and used. Charcoal is a comparatively cleaner fuel. Indoor pollution due to decay\\nof exposed kitchen waste can be reduced by covering the waste properly . Segregation of\\nwaste, pretreatment at source, sterilization of rooms will help in checking indoor air pollution.\\n(iii) Prevention and control of industrial pollution\\nIndustrial pollution can be greatly reduced by:\\n(a)use of cleaner fuels such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) in power plants, fertilizer\\nplants etc. which is cheaper in addition to being environmentally friendly .\\n(b)employing environment friendly industrial processes so that emission of pollutants and\\nhazardous waste is minimized.\\n(c)installing devices which reduce release of pollutants. Devices like filters, electrostatic\\nprecipitators, inertial collectors, scrubbers, gravel bed filters or dry scrubbers are\\ndescribed below:\\n(i)Filters  – Filters remove particulate matter from the gas stream. The medium of a filter\\nmay be made of fibrous materials like cloth, granular material like sand, a rigid material\\nlike screen, or any mat like felt pad. Baghouse filtration system is the most common\\none and is made of cotton or synthetic fibres ( for low temperatures) or glass cloth\\nfabrics (for higher temperature up to 290oC).\\n(ii)Electrostatic precipitators (ESP)-  The emanating dust is charged with ions and the\\nionized particulate matter is collected on an oppositely charged surface. The particles'),\n",

Sewage should be treated properly before\\nusing as fertilizer and as landfills. The organic matter from domestic, agricultural and other\\nwaste should be segregated and subjected to vermicomposting which generates useful\\nmanure as a by product. The industrial wastes prior to disposal should be properly treated\\nfor removing hazardous materials. Biomedical waste should be separately collected and\\nincinerated in proper incinerators.\\n INTEXT QUESTIONS 10.4\\n1.Define soil pollution.\\n______________________________________________________________\\n2.Why are plastic bags a big environmental nuisance?\\n______________________________________________________________\\n3.Vermicomposting degrades or ganic waste into a useful substance.

There are\\nmany sources of radiation pollution such as nuclear wastes from nuclear power plants,\\nmining and processing of nuclear material etc. The worse case of nuclear pollution was the\\ncherndoyl disaster in Russia occured in 1986 but the ef fects still longer today .\\n10.9.1 Radiation\\nRadiation  is a form of energy travelling through space. The radiation emanating from the\\ndecay of radioactive nuclides are a major sources of radiation pollution. Radiations  can be\\ncategorized into two groups namely the non-ionizing radiations and the ionizing radiations.\\nNon-ionizing radiations  are constituted by the electromagnetic waves at the longer\\nwavelength of the spectrum ranging from near infra-red rays to radio waves. These waves\\nhave energies enough to excite the atoms and molecules of the medium through which they\\npass, causing them to vibrate faster but not strong enough to ionize them. In a microwave\\noven the radiation causes water molecules in the cooking medium to vibrate faster and\\nthus raising its temperature.\\nIonizing radiations cause ionization of atoms and molecules of the medium through which\\nthey pass. Electromagnetic radiations such as short wavelength ultra violet radiations (UV),'),\n",

Chlorine from chemicals such as\\nchlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) used for refrigeration, air conditioning, fire extinguishers,\\ncleaning solvents, aerosols (spray cans of perfumes, medicine, insecticide) cause damage\\nto ozone layer chlorine contained in the CFCs on reaching the  ozone (O3) layer split the\\nozone molecules to form oxygen (O2). Amount of ozone, thus gets reduced and cannot\\nprevent the entry of UV radiation. There has been a reduction of ozone umbrella or shield\\nover the Arctic and Antarctic regions. This is known as ozone hole . This permits passage\\nof UV radiation on earth’ s atmosphere which causes sunburn, cataract in eyes leading to\\nblindness, skin cancer , reduced productivity of forests, etc. Under the “Montreal Protocol”\\namended in 1990 it was decided to completely phase out CFCs to prevent damage of\\nozone layer .\\n 10.5 GLOBAL  WARMING  AND GREENHOUSE EFFECT\\nAtmospheric gases like carbondioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, water vapour , and\\nchlorofluorocarbons are capable of trapping the out-going infrared radiation from the earth.\\nInfra-red radiations trapped by the earth’ s surface cannot pass through these gases and to\\nincrease thermal energy or heat in the atmosphere. Thus, the temperature of the global\\natmosphere is increased. As this phenomenon of increase in temperature is observed in'),\n",

If greenhouse gases are not checked, by\\nthe turn of the century the temperature may rise by 50C. This will melt the polar ice caps\\nand increase the sea level leading to coastal flooding, loss of coastal areas and ecosystems\\nlike swamps and marshes, etc.\\n 10.6 NOISE POLLUTION\\nNoise is one of the most pervasive pollutant. A musical clock may be nice to listen during\\nthe day , but may be an irritant during sleep at night. Noise by definition is “sound without\\nvalue” or “any noise that is unwanted by the recipient”. Noise in industries such as stone\\ncutting and crushing, steel forgings , loudspeakers, shouting by hawkers selling their wares,\\nmovement of heavy transport vehicles, railways and airports leads to irritation and an\\nincreased blood pressure, loss of temper , decrease in work ef ficiency , loss of hearing\\nwhich may be first temporary but can become permanent in the noise stress continues. It is\\ntherefore of utmost importance that excessive noise is controlled. Noise level is measured\\nin terms of decibels (dB). W.H.O. (W orld Health Or ganization) has prescribed optimum\\nnoise level as 45 dB by day and 35 dB by night. Anything above 80 dB is hazardous. The\\ntable10.4 gives the noise intensity in some of the common activities.\\nTable 10.4: Sources of some noises and their intensity\\nSource Intensity Source Intensity\\nQuiet Conversation 20-30dB Radio Music  50-60 dB\\nLoud Conversation 60 dB Traffic Noise 60-90 dB\\nLawn Mower 60-80 dB Heavy Truck 90-100 dB\\nAircraft Noise 90-120 dB Space Vehicle 140-179 dB\\nBeat Music 120 dB Launch\\nMotor Cycle 105 dB Jet Engine 140 dB\\n10.6.1 Sources of noise pollution\\nNoise pollution is a growing problem. All human activities contribute to noise pollution to\\nvarying extent. Sources of noise pollution are many and may be located indoors or outdoors.\\nIndoor sources  include noise produced by radio, television, generators, electric fans, air\\ncoolers, air conditioners, different home appliances, and family conflict. Noise pollution is\\nmore in cities due to a higher concentration of population and industries and activities such\\nas transportation. Noise like other pollutants is a by product of industrialization, urbanization\\nand modern civilization.')]"
